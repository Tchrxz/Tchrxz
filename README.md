- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tchrxz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in general, machine learning and all stuff around it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mechatronics at CEFET-MG / Brasil
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, anything, but the only programming languages I'm learning are C, Java and python. I'd be happy to help
- 📫 You can reach me via e-mail: chris.mecaassis@gmail.com or via discord @Tchrxz.X#5090
